1. Timely Delivery in Software Project Management
Timely delivery ensures project goals are met efficiently, minimizes cost overruns, and builds trust with stakeholders. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by:
- Setting Clear Milestones: Breaking projects into achievable segments.
- Effective Resource Management: Assigning tasks based on team strengths.
- Monitoring Progress: Regular check-ins and use of tracking tools.
- Risk Management: Anticipating potential delays and having contingency plans.


2.Effective Cost Control
Cost control avoids financial pitfalls and ensures resources are utilized effectively. Strategies include:
- Budget Planning: Estimate costs accurately at the outset.
- Regular Audits:Monitor expenditures against budgets.
- Scope Management: Prevent scope creep by aligning changes with goals.
- Vendor Negotiation: Optimize costs for external services or tools.


3. Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies
| Aspect                 | Agile                              | Waterfall                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Approach**           | Iterative, incremental            | Sequential, structured             |
| **Flexibility**        | High; adaptable to changes         | Low; predefined plans              |
| **Stakeholder Involvement** | Continuous                     | Limited to defined stages          |
| **Advantages**         | Faster response to changes; regular feedback | Clear documentation; stable process |
| **Disadvantages**      | Requires skilled team; less predictable costs | Difficult to adapt; higher initial planning costs |



 4. Project Suitability: Agile vs. Waterfall
- Agile:Ideal for dynamic projects, e.g., app development with evolving user requirements.
- Waterfall: Suitable for stable projects, e.g., designing a medical device where requirements are fixed.


5. Quality Assurance Methods
- Regular Testing: Unit, integration, and system tests.
- Code Reviews:Collaborative checks for consistency and errors.
- Automated Tools:Use tools like Selenium for testing.
- High Standards: Ensure reliability and user satisfaction.

6. Defining Project Scope
Defining scope prevents misunderstandings and ensures all stakeholders are aligned. The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is crucial—it breaks the project into smaller, manageable pieces, improving planning and accountability.


7.Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule
Schedules provide a roadmap and prevent missed deadlines. **Gantt Charts** visualize timelines, task dependencies, and progress, aiding effective coordination.


 8.Core Issues the Software Addresses
